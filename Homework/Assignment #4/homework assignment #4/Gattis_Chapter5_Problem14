//14. Rate of Inﬂation
//The annual rate of inﬂation is the rate at which money loses its value. For example, if the
//annual rate of inﬂation is 3.0%, then in one year it will cost $1030 to buy the goods that
//could have been purchased for $1000 today. Put another way, a year from now $1000 will
//only buy 1/1.03 * $1000, or $970.87, worth of goods. Two years from now $1000 will
//only buy only 1/1.03 of $970.87, or $942.59 worth of goods. Write a program that allows
//the user to enter an annual rate of inﬂation and then reports how much $1000 today will
//be worth each year for the next 10 years. 
//Input validation: Do not accept an inﬂation rate less than 1% or greater than 15%.
    
    
// 1/1.03 * $1000 ======= 1/
