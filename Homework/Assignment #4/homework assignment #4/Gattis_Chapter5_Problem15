//15. Population
//Write a program that will predict the size of a population of organisms. The program
//should ask the user for the starting number of organisms, their average daily population
//increase (as a percentage of current population), and the number of days they will multiply.
//A loop should display the size of the population for each day.
//Input Validation: Do not accept a number less than two for the starting size of the
//population. Do not accept a negative number for average daily population increase.
//Do not accept a number less than one for the number of days they will multiply
